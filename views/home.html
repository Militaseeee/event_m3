  <h2>About This Event platform</h2>
  <p>
    This project simulates a lightweight digital library management system. Whether you are a student, teacher, or reading enthusiast, this platform allows you to discover events, register new ones, and manage a simple collection with ease.
  </p>
  <p>
    Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, styled using clean CSS, and backed by a simulated REST API (JSON Server), this app is a great example of how front-end development can replicate real-world systems.
